   <h3>Short Biography of Yoshiharu Kimura
   <h4>Yoshiharu Kimura was born in Tokyo in 1934. He received accolades, winning a prestigious prize at the Nihon Banga-in Exhibition in 1957 and another at the Kokugakei Exhibition in 1965. In 1978, Kimura became a member of Kokugakei. Notably, between 1974 and 1979, he held annual one-man shows at Odakyu Department Store in Japan. His artistic journey expanded globally with a solo exhibition in Philadelphia, U.S.A., in 1988, alongside another showcase at the Yoseido Gallery in Tokyo, Japan.</h4>  
  
  
   <h5>Art Prints by Yoshiharu Kimura
   <h6>Yoshiharu Kimura predominantly works in the medium of the woodblock print. All prints observed thus far have been limited editions, bearing the artist's signature and numbering.</h6>
   <h6>Among the prints sold by artelino since 2001, twenty-five have featured birds as either the primary or secondary subject, often depicted within woodlands. Only one deviated from this theme, showcasing a Japanese stone garden. It's intriguing to witness the continuity of subject matter across several decades while observing the evolution of the artist's style. This evolution serves as a reflection of the ever-changing "Zeitgeist" in fashion and design trends, a phenomenon that fine arts have mirrored from the post-war era to the present day.
   For those who experienced the 1960s, reflecting on these prints offers an intriguing glimpse into a period that feels both intimately close and yet distantly removed. </h6>
